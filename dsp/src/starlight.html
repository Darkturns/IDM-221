        <p>So I keep coming upon these inflection points; crossroads in my life. In a story, I guess you’d call it the climax. The MC is faced with an impossible decision. It’s do or die, and in the movies there’s usually a sort of cathartic revelation followed by a paradigm shift//meaningful change. But I keep coming crossing these moments that categorically would be this, but nothing... I stay stagnate. I’m stuck.</p>
        <p>Maybe the passive nature of watching movies has led me to believe things will magically work itself out and it’s somehow preordained. I’m delusional. Fantasies are rarely reflected in reality. Maybe instead, I should look more inward and at my own motivations.</p>
        <p>I saw a tumblr-esque quote I liked along the lines of, “your dreams don’t work unless you do.” It rung hallow bc I’ve been without a dream for awhile.</p>
        <p>I took this photo(s) on my birthday. I’ve never felt more alone and lost then I did at that moment. Both literally and figuratively. This shot took two hours to take and in the meanwhile I sat waiting in the starlight. Imperfect and far from the best I’ve seen, this shot symbolically is everything I felt in that moment. It felt like my swan song because a part of me died, for better or worse on that field. Maybe it was to make room for something new; the change I’ve been hoping for.</p>
