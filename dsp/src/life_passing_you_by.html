        <h2>Vatican City</h2>
        <p>When I found out tripods were prohibited inside the Vatican Museum, I thought my vision for this shot had to be scraped. After checking-in my tripod at the door, I set out to find another way. I ended up macgyvering a stable platform, through a combination of using the railing and using my camera strap as a brace. Standing still as stone, I managed to get my shutter speed down to a few seconds, all pretty much handheld. This allowed for the visitors to have the motion-blurred effect. I managed to get some strange looks, and I was scared the museum staff would step in at one point, but Iâ€™m happy I was able to walk away with these shots.</p>
