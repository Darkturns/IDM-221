        <h1>First Storm</h1>
        <h2>New York CIty</h2>
        <p>It was a photographer's dream; New York City in a snowstorm. I remember seeing the forecast and preparing my gear the night before. I woke up at first light and took the first train to time square. I was so excited, that it didn't phase me my camera wasn't weather sealed. I just took a plastic bag and a rubber band and wrapped it around my camera body as a precaution. I must've looked crazy running from street corner to street corner with a mysterious bag wrapped up in my hands. I was afraid the cops would think it was a weapon. I remember barely being able to see through the snow. It was plummeting down, and to make matters worse, I lost my lens cleaner so I had to use my shirt to wipe off excess snow. But none of that really mattered, I was so happy being caught up in a perfect storm.</p>
        <p>I love this shot for a lot of reasons. First, for how it's framed. It's busy, but it works and the subject matter is so interesting. There's so much life and I really think it encapsulates NYC in that brief moment perfectly. Also because on the luck/timing that went into taking it. I shot this zoomed in from across the street. I wanted to compress the background and make it seem larger than life. So not only did I have to worry about snow getting on the lens and the strides of the people walking across the street, I had to account for the cars driving pass. All in all, it came out better than I imagined and now I'll have something to always remember my first snowstorm in NYC. - March 11th 2017</p>
